# Skin_cancer_CNN_model
Developed a Deep Learning model to detect skin cancer using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The project analyzes dermatoscopic images to classify lesions as malignant or benign with high precision. By automating feature extraction, it aims to assist in early diagnosis and improve medical screening efficiency using AI.
